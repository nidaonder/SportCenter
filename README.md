# Sport Center Responsive Website
Sport Center is a responsive website developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This site allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their Height and Weight information. There is also a "Our Classes" section that showcases various sports, a "Our Best Trainers" area that showcases our best trainers, and a "Contact" section with an active Google Map where users can enter their contact information.
